#Bootstrap Style Guide

This style guide is to serve as a kitchen sink for the common bootstrap 4 components. Here is the process that should be followed:

1. Designer creates style guide to match brand in the same format as the HTML style guide
2. UI developer creates CSS to make the HTMl style guide match te provided design
3. UI developer modifies any components markup to match provided design (as needed)
4. All developers now have a repository of common components, pre-styled to the brand guidelines
5. Designer and UI developer should update style guide as project evolves and changes

**Designer Notes:**
- Font sizes should always be in px (http://reeddesign.co.uk/test/points-pixels.html)
